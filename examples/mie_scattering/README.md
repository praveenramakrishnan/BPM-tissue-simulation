The subfolders contain the code for computing electric field using Mie theory for a
dielectric sphere placed at the origin.
The illumination field is a plane wave propagating along the z-axis and linearly
polarized along the x-axis.
- The folder "simple_mie_example/" provides an example for computing electric filed using Mie theory.
- In the folder "comparison_mie_and_bpm/", the code for comparison of BPM and Mie solution is given.
- In the folder "comparison_mie_and_bpm_parameter_sweep/", the code for the comparison of results with different sphere radii and sphere refractive indices is given.
